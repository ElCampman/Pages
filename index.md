# AWS Athena 
AWS Athena is a serverless interactive analytics offering by Amazon, which focuses on providing a means to query data stored in S3 buckets using SQL syntax. 

## Optimization
The AWS Athena [billing model](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing/) is primarily calculated from the volume of data scanned by each query.  As such it it would behoove us to leverage a means to reduce data scanned; to which there exists a few options.  In addition to realized cost savings, optimization techniques also serve to enhance query response performance.

### Partitioning
### Compression

## Use Cases
Given the relatively cheap storage cost of S3 (especially when compared to venues such as EBS), S3 presents itself as an ideal solution for mid to long term log retention, or even scenarios where aggregated log volume may render traditional hot storage options as cost prohibitive.
